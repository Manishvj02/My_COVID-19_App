1. Maintain a safe distance from others (at least 1 metre), even if they donâ€™t appear to be sick.
2. Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing is not possible.
3. Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.
4. Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
5. Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
